        <strong>Me:</strong> I've started with Web Development in 2006 in Torino, Italy.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        Over the past 12 years I've been working (mostly as a consultant) with perfectionist ‚ÄìType B‚Äì designers,
        complicated ‚ÄìType A‚Äì developers, and spent a countless amount of hours writing e-mails and attending meetings about planning, estimating, discussing (and mostly <em>fixing</em>) tech products with/for companies of any size.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        I enjoy teamwork, i am capable of handling <em>stressful tasks</em> and i'm usually very intrigued by any new venture that i get to know
        or work at. I also occasionally give advices to early stage startups struggling to bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <a href="http://sharedesk.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">My first venture</a> was co-founded in 2009
        with a team of friends and started to be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericaswallow/2012/10/17/sharedesk-coworking/" class="highlight">recognized</a>
        in 2012 as the <em>Airbnb for flexible Workplaces</em>, and it has been <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/sharedesk-raises-11-million-seed-round-2014-02-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">successfully funded</a>, and its seed round ($1.1M) was led by <a href="https://angel.co/dfj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-grey-darkest no-underline italic">Tim Draper's DFJ</a>.

      <p class="py-2">
        My second venture is called <a href="http://stood.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">stood</a> and started in early 2015.
        It's a wooden product (B2C+B2B) and early B2B customers include many Tech Companies and Events (<a class="text-grey-darkest no-underline italic" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/exoclick#/entity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exoclick</a>, <a class="text-grey-darkest no-underline italic" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/breather#/entity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">breather.com</a>, <em class="text-grey-darkest">google</em> and more).

        From 2017 I'm mentoring an <a href="https://busrapido.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">Italian Startup</a>, and from February 2018, I'm helping <a href="https://aeternity.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">√¶ternity</a> building its Blockchain SDK and Developer Tools.
