      Over the past 12 years I've been working (mostly as a consultant) with perfectionist ‚ÄìType B‚Äì designers,
      complicated ‚ÄìType A‚Äì developers, and spent a countless amount of hours writing e-mails and attending meetings about planning, estimating, discussing (and mostly <em>fixing</em>) tech products with/for companies of any size.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 leading-normal">
      I enjoy teamwork, i am capable of handling <em>stressful tasks</em> and i'm usually very intrigued by any new venture that i get to know
      or work at. I also occasionally give advices to early stage startups struggling to bootstrap.
