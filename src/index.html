    What I do

      My job is about helping businesses to build or improve their products (from scratch, simple ideas or existing projects)
      working at the intersection of people, technology, design and new medias.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 leading-normal">
      I've started with Web Development in 2006 in Torino, Italy.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 leading-normal">
      Over the past 11 years I've been working (mostly as a consultant) with perfectionist –Type B– designers,
      complicated –Type A– developers, and spent a countless amount of hours writing e-mails and attending meetings with small-to-big companies,
      mainly in Europe, USA and Canada.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 leading-normal">
      I enjoy teamwork, i am capable of handling <em>stressful tasks</em> and i'm usually very intrigued by any new venture that i get to know
      or work at. I also occasionally give advices to early stage startups struggling to bootstrap.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2 leading-normal">
      <a href="http://sharedesk.net" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">My first venture</a> was co-founded in 2009
      with a team of friends and became <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericaswallow/2012/10/17/sharedesk-coworking/" class="highlight">internationally recognized</a>
      in 2012 as the <em>Airbnb for flexible Workplaces</em>. Some time later it also <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/sharedesk-raises-11-million-seed-round-2014-02-19" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight">got successfully funded</a>, and its seed round ($ 1.1M) was led by Tim Draper.
      Today it's one of the main players in the Office Space and Coworking Business, also offering a <a href="http://www.optixapp.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight highlight--reskewed">solution for Smart Office Management</a>.

      <a href="http://stood.it" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="highlight highlight--reskewed">My second venture</a>, born in early 2015,
      is a wooden product (B2C+B2B).
      Early B2B customers includes many Tech Companies and Events (<a class="text-grey-darkest no-underline italic" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/exoclick#/entity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exoclick</a>, <a class="text-grey-darkest no-underline italic" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/breather#/entity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">breather.com</a>, <em class="text-grey-darkest">google</em> and more).
